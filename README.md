# Express-React Weather-App Project
This project is a weather app that can give users real world weather information using the React library. It works with a free weather API service. This project largely mirrors the Weather App project (https://github.com/ChrisB55/Weather-App) I made in December 2016, except that it uses React instead of AngularJS for contrast.
